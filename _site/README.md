<h4>👋 What will you find in this portfolio?</h4>
Welcome to my GitHub space! Here, I've gathered some of my projects and experiments in frontend development and design. You'll find web applications and interactive components built mainly with JavaScript, TypeScript, and React, along with other modern tools that bring intuitive and visually appealing interfaces to life.

<h4>🛠 Technologies and Tools</h4>
As a frontend developer, I love working with technologies that create smooth and optimized user experiences. In this portfolio, you'll find projects using:
- JavaScript and TypeScript for a solid and reliable code foundation.
- CSS and SASS for detailed, customized styling.

> **Coming soon:**
> - React for building modular, highly interactive interfaces.
> - And some experiments with APIs and other libraries to add extra functionality.

<h4>🎨 Focus on Design and Experience</h4>
Each project is crafted with an eye for detail, ensuring functionality and visual appeal. Beyond the code, I prioritize user experience (UX) and apply principles of modern design.

<h4>👀 Explore, Get Inspired, and Connect</h4>
Whether you're a fellow developer or just curious, feel free to browse, check out the code, and of course, share any feedback! This portfolio reflects my continuous learning journey and my passion for frontend development.
