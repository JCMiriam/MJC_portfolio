📁 Miriam Jurado Frontend Portfolio

👋 What will you find in this portfolio?
Welcome to my GitHub space! Here, I've gathered some of my projects and experiments in frontend development and design. You'll find web applications and interactive components built mainly with JavaScript, TypeScript, and React, along with other modern tools that bring intuitive and visually appealing interfaces to life.

🛠 Technologies and Tools
As a frontend developer, I love working with technologies that create smooth and optimized user experiences. In this portfolio, you'll find projects using:

JavaScript and TypeScript for a solid and reliable code foundation.
React for building modular, highly interactive interfaces.
CSS and SASS for detailed, customized styling.
And some experiments with APIs and other libraries to add extra functionality.
🎨 Focus on Design and Experience
Each project is crafted with an eye for detail, ensuring functionality and visual appeal. Beyond the code, I prioritize user experience (UX) and apply principles of modern design.
